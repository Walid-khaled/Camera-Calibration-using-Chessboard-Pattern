### Task description
Calibrate a camera (e.g., your phone) using the chessboard pattern. It’s logical to switch off the auto focus mode of the camera, if it is enabled. The number of images should be at least 30 (with different chessboard positions). Obtain the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Once you have calibrated your camera, store intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Then take a photo of some object (for example, a cup) using the calibrated camera, estimate the height and width of the selected object using both a ruler and an image from the calibrated camera. Calculate the distance between the camera image plane and the selected object, if possible.
